            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have had a deep exerciſe upon my ſpirit concerning many who are come to feel ſomething ſtirring and moving in their Hearts (that is good) to bring them into a ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of their courſe of life, and the inward ſtate of their Immortal Souls; and when you have ſometimes begun to turn your minds to this good thing that ſtirred in you, then have many Doubts and Objections ariſen in you, leſt you ſhould be <hi>Miſ-led, Deceived</hi> or <hi>Deluded;</hi> and leſt this thing that inwardly ſtrives with you ſhould <hi>lead you into the Erronious Way of the Quakers</hi> (as the world's Teachers call it) for they ſpeak, and write of, and bear a conſtant Teſtimony to ſomething that is in man, that calls upon him to Repent, and to turn to the Lord; and under this very
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46715:2"/>
Notion that ye have heard Evil, and thought evil of that People, by the ſame Rule you are apt to think evil of that which works in your own boſom to lead you out of Sin and Iniquity; and ſo ye are tempted to ſlight it, and to get ſome ſlighty name for it, to call it by, which Antichriſt's Miniſters have many to afford you; as to call it, <hi>A Natural Light; A Common Gift of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> but <hi>not</hi> a <hi>Saving Gift: Conviction of a Natural Conſcience; A Legal Work;</hi> yea, and many calls it, <hi>The Devils work to diſturb the Soul of its Peace;</hi> and ſome, <hi>A Diabolical Light, &amp;c.</hi> And thus when thou art brought to ſlight that good Principle (that ſtrives with thee) under ſome ſuch Name, thou getteſt eaſe again for a little while, and takeſt liberty to act againſt it, and to do and ſay that which this Principle doth in ſecret condemn; and then it riſeth again, and breaks thy peace, and brings trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Anguiſh upon thy Soul? and then up comes many Doubts on the one hand, and Doubts on the other hand, and thy poor Soul is beſet and encompaſſed with doubts and fears and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; ſometimes thou feareſt thou withſtandeſt the Truth to thy own Deſtruction, and ſometimes feareſt again its a Deluſion, and thou ſhalt be deceived; and beſides thou findſt many Learned men, and worldly-wiſe men that tell thee, that there is nothing good in thee; and here thou art in a great ſtrait, and laboureſt under many ſorrowful thoughts, and many doubtful diſputations ariſe in thy mind, the Fleſh now ſtrongly warreth againſt that which comes to diſturb it, and the Spirit ſtrongly warreth againſt that which reſiſts &amp; rebels againſt it, and theſe two are contrary, and theſe contrary things are both in thee, and thou poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt feel the ſtrugling of them both; and by reaſon of thy darkneſs, and doubts, and fears, thou ſcarce knows (or at leaſt with certainty) which is right: Now, in this ſtate and condition, how acceptable would a Meſſenger be, one of a thouſand, to ſhew unto ſuch a one that which might deliver his Soul from going down into the pit, and ſave his life from the Deſtroyer? (<hi>Job</hi> 33.23.) And truly very many are in this ſtraitned ſtate in theſe dayes; for whoſe ſakes I am drawn into a deep exerciſe many times, by day, and by night, and my cry to God is, that his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious power may more and more ariſe to open theſe doors that are ſhut and folded upon many ſuch, and to bring forth the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46715:2"/>
ſpirits out of the Priſon-houſe, and out of the Bondage of this Spiritual <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where our Lord was and is crucified Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually; and that he may expel the clouds of darkneſs, in which the fears, and doubts, and qeuſtionings ariſe; and that he may make a clear way in all ſuch for his Light to break forth out of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, in which the anſwer to thoſe <hi>Doubts</hi> and <hi>Queſtions</hi> do ariſe.</p>
            <p>And by that ſame Spirit that labours with you, am I moved to ſend this forth unto you all, as a word of Exhortation and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in the Name and fear of the Lord God, by which as many as do rightly receive it, and make a true uſe and proof of it, ſhall find help and benefit, and ſhall know the mouth of the Queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtopped, and the Anſwer of Peace witneſſed to their Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Souls, in the Lords due time. And therefore, conſider this, <hi>That every good and perfect Gift cometh from above, from the Father of Lights &amp; Spirits,</hi> who would not the Death of a Sinner, but rather that he ſhould turn and live; and therefore hath he out of his infinite Love, and tender Mercies to the Sons of Men, prepared a way to draw nigh unto them, even while they are in their Sins, which he doth not but thorow Jeſus Chriſt, the Mediator of the New-Covenant, whom he hath freely given to be a Light unto the dark World; and that he ſhould <hi>Enlighten every one that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the World,</hi> John 1.9. of which Number thou art one, whoever thou art, and art enlightned by Chriſt, though thou be yet Darkneſs in thy ſelf, as the <hi>Epheſians</hi> once were; yet the Light ſhineth in thy Darkneſs, or elſe there would not be two contrary Natures and Seeds found working in thee as there is, and this Light wherewith thou art enlightned is the <hi>Life of Jeſus,</hi> John 1.4. which he hath given a Ranſom for man; and that was not <hi>Natural,</hi> as ſome fooliſhly imagine: for if it were Natural, it could not be a Ranſom for man out of Sin; for the Sin to be Natural, and that which reproves it Natural, is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Apoſtle, who ſaid, they two that warred in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were contrary; and called the one <hi>Fleſh</hi> or <hi>Natural,</hi> and the other <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Spiritual;</hi> and Chriſt Jeſus called that which ſhould Reprove the World of Sin, <hi>The Spirit of Truth;</hi> and Antichriſt and his Miniſters call it, <hi>A Natural Inſufficient Light,</hi> &amp;c. But know this, thou that art enquiring, <hi>That that in thee which doth make manifeſt things to thee that are reproveable, that's the Light wherewith Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightned thee withal,</hi> as the Apoſtle
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46715:3"/>
of Chriſt ſaid in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> chap. 5. v. 13, 14. and that Principle which leads thee to do or ſay ſuch things as thou art ſecretly reproved for in thine own Conſcience, that is the Darkneſs, and the Enemy of thy Souls Peace, which who walks in, doth not know whether he goeth; for this doth miniſter a Peace and Pleaſure to thee, and a delight to thy carnal Mind for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; yet the other, to wit, the Light, the Reprover hath power to take away peace from thee again, and to judge thee, and to make that which was ſweet to thee to become hitter; and the Darkneſs, nor Luſt, nor Vanity of thy mind cannot deliver thee from this ſtroke.</p>
            <p>Now, that thou mightſt be reſolved in ſuch a ſtate what to do, conſider thou that haſt theſe ſtruglings in thee about the Light in thy conſcience, whether it is true or no, or whether thou ſhalt own it or no, and art thinking in thy ſelf what is beſt for thee to do; whether to go on ſtoutly againſt it, or to ſubmit to it: I ſay, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if thou rebeleſt againſt it, thou canſt never know whither it would lead thee; as it was ſaid of old, <hi>Job</hi> 24. <hi>They that rebel againſt the Light, they know not the Way of it;</hi> ſo that if thou doſt take that courſe to rebel, that will but increaſe thy ignorance of the Way that the Light leads in, and makes it more terrible to thee every time it doth appear in thee, till thou comeſt to that ſtate ſpoken of, <hi>Job</hi> 24.17. <hi>That the dawning of the Day will be as the ſhadow of Death;</hi> for the more thou rebelſt againſt it, the more dark thou wilt daily grow, and ſo the leſs able to reſolve thy ſelf in thoſe doubtful things that fill thy mind; but as Darkneſs increaſeth in thee, ſo the Power of it will bind thee down as a Chain, and ſmother every good deſire in thee; and thus by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt the Light, do ſome men loſe the very ſence and knowledge of it, and grow paſt feeling, and ſtrangers to it, though it be in them; for the cuſtom of Sin taketh away the ſence and the feeling of the burthen of it. But to you I write that are not yet come to this ſtate of hardneſs of Heart, but are brought daily into a ſence of the burthen of Sin; and that are ready to ſay, <hi>If you were but ſure that were the Truth and way of God which ſhews you your Sin, you would follow it, and love it and own it,</hi> but are kept off by Doubts and Queſtionings: Verily I ſay unto you, before theſe doubts be reſolved, you muſt try this, as to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46715:3"/>
your Sorrow you have tried the other, before you can be effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed; for Arguments will not do ſufficiently in this caſe; therefore try and prove what this Principle can do for thee, when thou obeyſt it, which ye know hath power to condemn you, and break your Peace when you diſobey it: Why ſhould ye always be ſhut up in Unbelief, and in Doubts, and ſo kept from trying &amp; proving the Light, as well as ye have proved the Darkneſs, that ſo ye might reap the fruit of it to Salvation, as well as you have done the fruit of the other unto Condemnation? Oh, dear peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! conſider, ye cannot obey this Light of Chriſt Jeſus in your Conſciences, but by taking up a daily Croſs to your own Wills, Luſts and Affections; for that is contrary thereunto; and that which leads to obey your Luſts, leads to diſobey the Light; and that which leads to obey the Light, that croſſeth the Luſts and vile Affections, which are at enmity with the Light, and muſt by it be judged and condemned; and that which leads thee to ſlight it, and call it by ſome ſlighty name, that's alſo an Enemy to it, and muſt be judged by it; and ſo, as the Light comes to rule over thoſe things in thee, which are enemies to it, thou wilt know that it will lead thee contrary to thy corrupt Nature; and as thou feeleſt the thing ſo in thy ſelf, thou wilt come to be wiſer then thoſe Teachers that have called it <hi>a Natural Light;</hi> for that which is Natural leadeth according to Nature, but that which is Spiritual, leadeth according to the Spirit, which the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>was contrary to the Fleſh, and warred againſt it.</hi> And ſo that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection will, by thy obeying the Light, come to be anſwered, far better then words and arguments could have anſwered it; and ſo likewiſe the ſufficiency of the Light thou wilt come to feel if thou doſt not oppoſe it, but give up to be guided by it; and wilt know that it is able to deliver thee when thou art tempted, as well as to judge thee when thou haſt yeilded to the Tempter: for thou knowſt already, that it is able to condemn thee when thou ſinneſt againſt it: but thou canſt not certainly know it ſufficient to give, Peace, and to juſtifie, till thou obeyeſt it: So then, the <hi>plain Path-way</hi> to the anſwering thy doubts about the Principle to Truth in the inward-parts, is, by obeying of it and yielding to it; for they that do Evil, they grow into Hatred againſt it, and it judges them, as they deny to obey the Light, ſo the Light denies
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46715:4"/>
to juſtifie them, and ſo coming juſtly under the condemnation of it, by reaſon of tranſgreſſion they grow afraid of it. But alas! this doth but prove that it is ſent of God, for it doth Gods work, which is Righteous; <hi>For to juſtifie the Wicked, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Righteous, both theſe are an abomination to the Lord;</hi> and ſo is it with his Witneſs in thy own Conſcience, which God hath placed there to bear witneſs for him, concerning all thy actions, whether they are Good or Evil; and thou thy ſelf, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art, whether High or Low, Rich or Poor, Profeſſor or Prophane, ſhalt confeſs unto this, <hi>That this hath never condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thee for that which was good, nor born witneſs againſt thee for that thou waſt not guilty of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore all you that have been hurried and toſſed with Doubts and Queſtionings about the Truth, Come, hearken to the Counſel of God, at this time once more ſounded forth unto you, from his Spirit, by a Servant of his without you, and anſwered by the meaſure of his good Spirit within you, which hath the ſame voice and cry in you, <hi>for Obedience to what is made manifeſt of God in you;</hi> Obey the Light, and ye ſhall ſee daily more of it, till it break forth as a Morning unto thee, and till it ſhines unto a perfect day; yea, a day of Gladneſs and Rejoyceing to thy poor diſtreſſed Soul.</p>
            <p>Oh! Ariſe thou that ſits ſorrowing, and thou that art crying out in ſecret, becauſe of the Bonds and Fetters that are yet upon thee! Ariſe, ariſe, I ſay, in the Name of the Lord God of <hi>Sion,</hi> who draws nigh to thee by his quickning Spirit, and hearken to his Voice, who ſaith to the Priſoner, <hi>Come forth;</hi> and to the bowed down, <hi>Ariſe;</hi> and to the feeble Ones, <hi>Put on ſtrength, and follow me; I will confound your Foes, and break the ſtrength of your Enemies, as I have done for my People, who have forſaken all to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me; and obey me, ſo will I do for you: and if ye in uprightneſs walk before me, and keep my Covenant, as they have done, no power or ſtrength of the Enemy within or without ſhall be too hard for you.</hi> And when the Lord doth thus ariſe in your Souls, and ſtir up his own pure Witneſs, and his Arm awakens in you, and his pure Light breaks forth; Oh! what Conſolation is it to you, and how have many of you ſeen your vain Doubtings expelled, and a clear Convincement hath prevailed upon your ſpirits concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46715:4"/>
the way of God; and at ſuch a time you have begun to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to follow the Lord in his pure Way of Holineſs, thus open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you in the Light, though to the loſs of all; and though it be to the bearing your part of the great reproach that lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them that love him more then their Lives; and at ſuch a time there was felt a ſecret joy in a hidden ground in your Souls, and the ſeed of the Kingdom that had been long buried up, began to ſpring up in you, in which Seed your Souls felt ſome touchings of that <hi>heavenly Life</hi> &amp; <hi>Joy,</hi> which for the time exceeded all things that this World could afford; and whenſoever ye come to feel this refreſhing dew upon your Souls, then take heed and wait ſingly in the ſence of it, keep your Eye to the joy that is now ſet before you in Chriſt Jeſus, the Seed; for if you let your minds wander, and your eyes gad abroad, there be objects on every hand to lead you out from your Souls beloved, and to bring you to defile your hearts, and make your ſelves an unfit place of reſidence for him who is holy and pure, and will not dwell, nor take delight in a polluted Temple; but will withdraw himſelf, as he did from <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, and from their Temple, when it was polluted and prophaned: And beſides, when your minds are taken hold of by any of the corruptible things in this chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able World, there will preſently kindle a deſiring, longing and luſting after the enjoyment of thoſe things, though contrary to the will of God; and then next, the Reaſoner and Conſulter gets up in thee, and ſtarts a queſtion; <hi>May not I enjoy the Lord and this? May not I keep in the Way of Truth, and yet do this or that thing which my heart deſireth? And though it be not perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Truth made manifeſt in me; yet I will have my Will, my Luſt, my Deſire ſatisfied but this one time, and that's not much,</hi> ſaith the Conſulter; <hi>and this is but a ſmall matter; there be others that do greater things then this;</hi> and ſuch like reaſonings enter the mind, and this grieves and vexeth that good and Righteous tender Spirit that moved in thee, and brings a weight and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon the pure in thee, and that withdraws it ſelf again from thee, in which thy Light did ariſe unto thee, and ſo a night comes upon thee; for where the Serpent can bring any to make a queſtion of obeying the Truth, he is as ready to frame an Anſwer, as to beget the Queſtion; but his anſwer always comes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46715:5"/>
with a Liberty and perſwaſion to diſobey, as it did by <hi>Eve</hi> in the beginning; and when Tranſgreſſion is finiſhed, then Death en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon thee with its dark Power, and manifold Sorrows pierceth thy poor Soul; though the fruit was deſirable to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, yet now it is eaten, thou canſt not come at life, to eat of that too, though thou deſireſt it; but art driven out, and kept out <hi>with a flaming Sword, that turns every way againſt thee:</hi> And here's now a ground laid for Doubts and Queſtioning of a higher na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then before, to raiſe in thee; for before thou doubtedſt of the Truth it ſelf, whether it were the Truth, but now having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of it, and received a Convincement of it, and yet let forth thy mind from it after other Lovers, &amp; thy ears after the voice of the Adultereſs, and ſo cauſed the pure Light to withdraw from thee, thorow thy Rebellion: Now thou deſireſt thou mightſt but ſee again what thou haſt ſeen, and feel again what thou haſt felt, but doubtſt &amp; fearſt that thou ſhalt never ſee, nor feel, nor enjoy the like again, and now thou wiſheſt, O that thou hadſt ſtood in the Croſs to thy own will, &amp; that thou hadſt denied thy ſelf, that thou mightſt not thus have loſt the ſight and ſence of thy Souls Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! And now thou ſeeſt, by Woful experience, whence Doubts and Fears, and Sorrows do ariſe, even thy joyning with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who brings forth Reaſons againſt the obedience to the Light: And therefore now hearken to that which remains in thee, though <hi>darkneſs</hi> &amp; <hi>ſorrow</hi> doth encompaſs thee; yet there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remains, which gives thee a ſence of thy ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and makes thee to know thy loſs and want: hear the voice of this, and this will humble thee, and bring thee into true bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs of heart, and contriteneſs of ſpirit; and as thou comeſt to know that ſtate, then thou haſt ſomething to offer to the Lord of his own preparing, which will be far more acceptable to him then a multitude of Words &amp; Preformances &amp; Duties (ſo called;) and as thou in the true lowlineſs of mind doſt come before the Lord, and offers up this offering, God will hear in Heaven, and will anſwer the Cry of the poor and needy Soul that cannot be ſatisfied without his preſence; and he will remember his Mercies of old (which never fail) for his ſeeds ſake, which is not yet brought forth in thee: And when God doth again ſhine forth unto thee, and make his Power known, thou muſt expect it

muſt be in judgment, becauſe of the tranſgreſſion thou haſt gone into, that he may conſume that in thee which led thee into the Sin, from his pure Law, which is Lgiht; for <hi>Zion is Redeemed by Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> And therefore take heed leſt thou be offended at his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; take heed that thou limit not the Holy One; but if his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance be with more ſharpneſs and bitterneſs to the carnal part than before, it is but juſt it ſhould be ſo, <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what he will,</hi> he ſees more cauſe now than before, by how much more thou haſt ſinned againſt his goodneſs; but bow to his Judgments, <hi>Bear his Indignation,</hi> (as <hi>Micah</hi> ſaid) <hi>becauſe thou haſt ſinned againſt him,</hi> Mic. 7.9. And as thou yieldſt to his righteous Judgment, thou wilt know the coming to the midſt of them, in which <hi>the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is remembred</hi> and made manifeſt; and therefore the haſty and impatient, that flee the Judgment as ſoon as it begins a little to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in them, they never find the true deliverance, but get eaſe another way, which laſteth but for a moment; but they who come to know a thorow work wrought in their Earth, and the Floor thorowly purged, they come to know the true and laſting Peace to their Immortal Souls. And although this is not obtained by eaſe and liberty to the carnal mind, which muſt dye, yet the end Crowns all that hold out to it, they are the ſaved ones, as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.13. And they find the returning with ſheaves, as the Prophet ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.5, 6. <hi>They that ſow in Tears ſhall reap in Joy: They went forth</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>with weeping, and bearing precious Seed, but they ſhall return with joy, and bring their Sheaves.</hi> And as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>They that forſake Father and Mother, Wife and Children, Houſe or Lands, yea, or their own Lives for my ſake, ſhall have an hundred fold in this time, and in the World to come Life Everlaſting.</hi> Forſaking and Self-denial hath always been the way to Life, and to true Bleſſedneſs, and is the way unto this day.</p>
            <p>And therefore all you who have wandred in your own ways, and have not yet learned to deny your ſelves of what is contrary to the Witneſs of God in your Conſciences, but have deſires, and that ſtrong ones too, to keep and hold that ſtill which the Light in you doth reprove, and yet have deſires of Life and Peace too; and ſo are in many doubts and ſtraits about theſe things. To you all, this is the Counſel of the Lord, and the cry of his pure Spirit; <hi>Come out of the Babyloniſh Confuſion of your own thoughts, and touch not that which is unclean, and the Lord will receive you:</hi> And what
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46715:6"/>
God by his pure Spirit hath called <hi>unclean,</hi> let no man preſume to call <hi>clean,</hi> and to joyn to it, leſt they be found fighting againſt God, and nouriſhing and keeping that a live which God hath appointed to die and be deſtroyed: ye cannot ſerve two Maſters, nor pertake of the Table of the Lord and the Table of Devils. Oh! ſeed not that birth that hungers after evil things, and delights in them; <hi>but what is for famine, let it be famiſhed; and what is for the Sword, let the two-edged Sword that goeth out of the mouth of the faithfull and true Witneſs cut it down, (Rev.</hi> 1.16. and 3.14.) And ſo thou mayſt ſee the Gyants in the Land ſlain before thee by one that is mighty to deliver, and to bring thee out of this Spiritual <hi>Egypt</hi> with a high hand: But this thou canſt not come to witneſs, but by diligent following him; and if thou willingly yieldſt to his gentle drawings, when thou feeleſt them in thy heart, thou wilt find them to be effectual and profitable to thy Soul; and the more thou follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt him, the more thou wilt feel his goodneſs break in upon thee for thy encouragement, and the leſs thou wilt doubt of his love and mercy in leading thee ſtill farther, even unto the end, and unto that Reſt which will ſatisfie thy Soul.</p>
            <p>Therefore lay aſide all Conſultations that are againſt thy Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Gift of God in thy heart, which reproves Sin in thee; and give not way to vain and needleſs doubts about it, but as thou findſt that thou haſt been condemned &amp; judged in thy diſobeying of it; now try and prove whether by taking up thy daily Croſs, and obeying of it in thy words and actions, and in all things, if thou doſt not find the anſwer of ſweet <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>joy;</hi> and when thou ſhalt find it ſo, then will there be no more room for doubts and queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt thy obeying of it; but as any Queſtions or Doubts do ariſe in thee, or ſhall be caſt in thy way by any without thee, thou wilt feel the anſwer of it in thy ſelf to thy refreſhing, and ſo thou wilt come to witneſs the effectual operation of it daily in thy Soul to work thy change and tranſlation out of thy ſelf into it ſelf, and ſo thou wilt come not only to know the Light in thee; for that, one may do and periſh, <hi>(For this is the Condemnation, that Light is come, and not loved)</hi> but thou wilt know that thou art in the Light, and walkeſt there with God, and in the holy Fellowſhip, where thou feelſt the Lord near thee in his Light, and his Reward is with him: and ſo coming to walk and dwell in the Light, thy Converſation is now in Heaven, as the Saints of old was, and thy unity is witneſſed <hi>with the Father and the Son,</hi> as theirs was, who ſaid, <hi>If we walk in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46715:6"/>
the Light as he is in the Light, they had fellowſhip with him; and if any ſaid they had fellowſhip, and walked in Darkneſs</hi> (which all Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners do, for Sin is the work of it) <hi>ſuch,</hi> they ſaid, <hi>were Lyars: And ſuch as walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, ſuch come to know the Blood that cleanſeth and waſheth from the Sin, and from all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs.</hi> And ſuch as feel this work wrought in them, are brought into ſuch a knowledge of the Blood of Chriſt, that they need not doubt about it, nor have they occaſion to raiſe a queſtion, where it is or what it is, nor what the efficacy of it is; for having the work and witneſs of the Blood in them, this forthwith reſolves all doubts that would ariſe; and ſo likewiſe thoſe that come to know the Light in all things to be their Guide to lead out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Sin, and Imperfections, and to bring into the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and Blameleſs Converſation which becometh Saints, and ſo come to know their footſteps directed before the Lord, ſuch have done doubting and queſtioning about Perfection; for ſuch ſee that which is perfect to be come, and they from the belief which they have of attaining it, are labouring to conform themſelves unto that rule, and endeavouring after it, not as the carnal Profeſſors, (who ſay, they labour after a Conqueſt over their Sins, with a belief they ſhall never attain it while they live;) but they ſo run that they may attain, and have the true hope in them, which they that have, are purifying themſelves as he is pure, that is their hope; as <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>He that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf as God is pure,</hi> that ſo, <hi>Even as he was in this preſent World, ſo they may be alſo:</hi> And ſo here the Subſtance will come, and will cauſe the ſhadow to flee, and will anſwer all thy Doubts and Queſtions far beyond what Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can do.</p>
            <p>And again, the many doubts and diſputations that have ariſen about the Reſurrection, as thou comeſt to be faithful in the daily Croſs, that doth ſlay and crucifie that nature in thee that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the Truth, and held the Seed in bondage; as that comes to die, and to be buried down in the true Baptiſm into Chriſts Death, thou wilt feel the Pure to ſpring up in thee, and thou wilt be made a partaker of the new Life, and the true Reſurrection, which is Chriſt, and all that are in him are in the Reſurrection, and in the Life; for he ſaid, <hi>I am the Reſurrection and the Life, he that believeth on me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live;</hi> and this living to God, in the Spirit of his Son, is the firſt Reſurrection, which whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46715:7"/>
come to witneſs, the ſecond death hath no power over them, but they come to know the thing as it is in Jeſus, and their doubts are all anſwered about that alſo; for he that knows a death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection after this manner, <hi>To be dead to Sin, and to be riſen with Chriſt Jeſus in the new Life,</hi> even while they are in this earthly Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, before it is diſſolved, ſuch will never queſtion their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing at the judgment Seat of God after it is diſſolved, but do believe it with joy and gladneſs, and have a fervent hope concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reſurrection of the dead, and have their expectation unto God in that matter, that he will, according to his promiſe raiſe them up at the laſt day, and will give unto every Seed his own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, even as pleaſeth him; and the Creature is not careful then about ſuch fooliſh queſtions and doubts, as to enquire what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Body God will give them? but leaves it to the Lord in full faith, that he will raiſe them up, according to the Scriptures: And ſo here all thy doubts will flee away, and are anſwered with that that was before them, as it comes to rule in the Creature, and Death that is the root &amp; ground of them, comes to be ſwallowed up in the Victory of the Life.</p>
            <p>And ſo, as thou feelſt thy part in this Reſurrection, all the doubts and fears of thy own condition will he anſwered effectually, which cannot otherwiſe be anſwered, but by that good Sprit of God that ſtrives with thee, which, when it doth prevail with thee, and thou becomeſt ſubject to it, then it witneſſeth for thee; for that there is a ſtate in which there is a danger of falling away, thy daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teacheth thee to thy ſorrow; and beſides, Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Every Branch in me that beareth not fruit muſt be cut off;</hi> and the many examples in Scripture of them that departed from the Faith, and made ſhipwrack of it, and turned with the Dog to the vomit, and the Sow to the mire, doth ſufficiently prove it; and if thou doſt ſtand, it is by Faith, and thou muſt take heed, and ſo mayſt thou come to the Crown, and Seal, and Aſſurance, and an Eſtabliſhment in the Kingdom, where thou ſhalt no more go forth, but ſhalt have thy Soul's deſire anſwered.</p>
            <p>And when thou comeſt to know this ſtate, and to receive this White Stone that hath the Name within, thou wilt then be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt or fear, given up in the will of God to do and to ſuffer all things, according to his bleſſed will: And here is the true and perfect Reſt to thy Soul, whoever thou art, that art now labouring
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46715:7"/>
in the Iron Furnace of thy own thoughts and doubts, in the which the more thou giveſt thy ſelf up thereto, the darker thou art, and the fuller of doubts; for they will beget and multiply one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the more thou reaſoneſt againſt obeying Gods Witneſs in thy heart, the leſsable thou art to obey it; but the little ſtrength which God gives thee, thou conſulteſt it away, and then when thou wouldſt be ſtrong, thou becom'ſt feeble; and when thou wouldſt in ſome meaſure obey, thy own Conſultation ſtands in the way, and hinders thee; and the more thou increaſeſt in knowledge in this ſtate, the more thou increaſeſt thy Sorrow and Condemnation; ſo that ſometimes thou art ready to wiſh thou hadſt never known ſo much of Truth; and ſometimes wiſheſt; <hi>thou knewſt more concerning ſuch a Point,</hi> or <hi>ſuch a Doctrine,</hi> or <hi>ſuch a Scripture,</hi> or <hi>ſuch a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,</hi> and art apt to think, becauſe thou art yet ignorant in ſome things relating to Truth, <hi>therefore thou art the more excuſable if thou be diſobedient.</hi> But alas! poor Soul, conſider, the way to know more is to be obedient to a little, which thou haſt received, and then that Miſt and Fog of thy own unfaithfulneſs will vaniſh away from before the Eye of thy mind; for it is that which hinders good things from thee, and makes thee go daily with a burthen upon thy ſhoulders &amp; a guilt upon thy Conſcience, &amp; thou canſt not, in no caſe of thy neceſſities, come before the Lord with an open face, but art covered ſtill with thine own iniquities; and in this ſtate thou knoweſt neither Sabbath, nor new Moon, nor Holy-day to the Lord; but all labour, toyl and travel, and weariſomneſs of ſpirit till many even come to wiſh an end of their dayes, &amp; yet are in great fear that the end will be worſe too. Oh! how my Soul pities you whoſe ſtate this is, and I have a great ſympathy with your ſorrows, &amp; in bowels of tender love am I drawn forth to reach out a hand to help you, as one that hath obtained mercy to know deliverances, and to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the way of it, and have the teſtimony of God in my heart to witneſs forth the coming of the Saviour to the poor &amp; needy Souls, to the relieving of them, and comforting of them; and my Souls deſire is, that your Bonds might be broken, and your Souls might eſcape. But this I ſay, in the Name of the Lord to you all, <hi>There is no way for your deliverance but your giving up in ſingle obedience to that faithfull and true Witneſs of God which ſtirs and moves in thee againſt thy ſins;</hi> and therefore wait thou to feel thy mind and will ſubjected thereunto, that thou mayſt feel thy ſelf to be one of thoſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46715:8"/>
willing people, in this the day of Gods Power; and ceaſe from thy reaſonings againſt thy obeying the Truth, and from ſaying, <hi>thou canſt not, thou wantſt Power, and when God gives thee Grace, then thou wilt obey;</hi> for theſe ſayings are in vain. For though it is true, none can obey the Lord but by his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> given unto them, yet he hath made his <hi>Grace even that which bringeth Salvation, to appear unto all men,</hi> as in <hi>Titus</hi> 2.11. and it hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto thee, and in thee to whom I write, and is a Reprover in thee, and thou muſt turn to that that ſmites thee, and then thou turneſt to the <hi>Grace of God;</hi> for its his <hi>Grace</hi> that ſtrives with thee to lead thee out of the Evil that it reproves in thee, and ſo out of the World that lies in the Evil, up to God from whence the Grace cometh; for whoſoever doth give up to the drawings of the good Spirit of God that moves in them, and in obedience thereto do deny themſelves of their own Wills, and Luſts, and evil De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and Pleaſures, ſuch want not Power, but feel him near them, that works the willingneſs firſt, and then the deed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his pleaſure, and ſo the glory comes alone to be his; and then thou knoweſt the Myſtery of the Croſs, and how it is <hi>the Power of God,</hi> which all that reject the Croſs complain for want of. And ſo, ſo long as thou liveſt in the <hi>Croſs</hi> thou liveſt in the <hi>Power,</hi> and thy obeying is eaſie, and all things are poſſible to thee through it; and as long as thou art daily dying to that which is corruptible, thou feeleſt the more Life, and Joy, and Pleaſure in that which is Everlaſting, and thy deſires grow more and more fervent after a full and perfect Enjoyment of it, in the pure Unity of Spirit: And thoſe deſires growing ſtrong in thee, it grows a lighter thing to thee to part with that which hinders, though it be thy <hi>Boſom ſins,</hi> thy <hi>Delilahs</hi> and <hi>Darlings,</hi> yet all muſt go for the love thou haſt to <hi>Truth;</hi> and ſuch only as have this Love, and continue in it, are counted worthy to be Heirs of the Kingdom of God; for ſo long as any thing be hugged and loved beſides the Lord, if the Lord ſhould manifeſt his Love to thee, thou wouldſt play the Harlot, and abuſe his Mercies, and cleave to thy old Lovers, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old did that was after the Fleſh: and therefore, think it not ſtrange to be brought through manifold Tryals, that thereby thou mayſt be purged and prepared as a Bride for the true Husband, <hi>Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;</hi> for there are many that deſire acquaintance with him, but are not fitted for him; they muſt be waſhed firſt, and trimmed

firſt, and muſt put off the vile Raiment firſt, and muſt come to know the white Linnen put on: And while this work is doing, what need of Patience and Quietneſs of Spirit is there! what need of Subjection to the workings of that holy Spirit in all things! that thou mayſt not be ſetting limits &amp; bounds to that which muſt bound and limit thee in all things; nor ſay in thine heart, <hi>If my Trials were but ſo, or my Exerciſes ſo or ſo, I could then bear them;</hi> but rather ſubmit in all things, willingly to do and ſuffer, and to be tried and exerciſed, even as it pleaſeth the Lord to order, or ſuffer thee to be tried; and in all his dealings ſay, with the good man, <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what he will with thee:</hi> And whoſoever gives up thus to him, though he ſlay them, yet ſhall they live; though he wound them, yet he will heal them again. Therefore learn pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſtillneſs of mind, for by taking thought thou canſt add no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this work. I remember <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, who were commanded <hi>to ſtand ſtill to ſee the Salvation of God in their greateſt ſtraits,</hi> and they were a figure unto thee: And now in the Light read thy figure, and wait for the Subſtance, the true Seed, that it may bring forth peace and reſt to thy Immortal Soul, and may ſet up Righteouſneſs in thy Earth; which is that I travel after, on the behalf of all diſtreſſed and afflicted Souls every where, to whom I am a Friend and Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſher, as one knowing their Trials, Straits, Doubts and Beſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; and alſo, through the rich love of God in Chriſt Jeſus, do witneſs the delivering, anſwering and ſatisfying Life, made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and revealed in its own Eternal Light, <hi>which lighteth every man;</hi> and in true deſire that you may all know the ſame, and in diſcharge of my duty towards God and my Generation, have I ſent forth this word of Counſel and Exhortation, and do remain in my Reſt with the Lord, being thus far clear of the Blood of all men, whether they hear or forbear; and though in Bonds for the Goſpel ſake, yet the Lords Free-man, waiting in patience and full aſſurance for <hi>Zion</hi>'s full Redemption.</p>
